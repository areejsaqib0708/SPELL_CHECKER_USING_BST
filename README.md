# SPELL CHECKER USING BST 
# Description

This is a simple console-based spell checker program written in C++. The program reads words from a file (DATA.txt) and builds a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient word search. It allows users to input words to check their spelling. If the word is not found in the dictionary, it suggests similar words and offers the option to add the new word to the dictionary.

# Features
➡️Converts All Words to Lowercase: Ensures uniformity by converting all words to lowercase before processing.

➡️Check for Word Correctness: Utilizes BST search to verify if the entered word is correct.

➡️Suggests Similar Words: Provides suggestions for similar words with a high hit rate if the entered word is not found.

➡️Interactive Dictionary Expansion: Allows users to add new words to the dictionary interactively.

➡️Colorful Console Interface: Uses the <windows.h> library for colorful outputs, making the console interface more attractive.

C++ Compiler

conio.h and windows.h libraries
